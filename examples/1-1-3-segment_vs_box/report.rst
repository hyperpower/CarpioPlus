Problem Description
===================

We want to find intersection results of a line vs box.

Line vs Box - Normal
---------------------
The box is fixed at (0,0) to (1,1). A line passes through the box. Two intersect points can be found.

   :align: center 

   A line intersects with box (Normal).

Line vs Box - Corner
---------------------
The box is fixed at (0,0) to (1,1). A corner of the box is on the line.

.. figure:: _static/{{folder_name}}/line_box_corner.png
   :align: center 

   A line intersects with box (Corner).

Line vs Box - Edge
--------------------
The box is fixed at (0,0) to (1,1). The line is on one edge of the box. 

.. figure:: _static/{{folder_name}}/line_box_edge.png
   :align: center 

   A line intersects with box (Edge).
